Description: RealTime OpenControl is a universal measurement, plot and control-software.
        It's purpose is to put measurements from different devices (for example 3d-printers, multimeters, power supplies, microcontroller,...) into one tool.
        Its fully expandable for every device with Python-Plugins and a running TCP-server.
        You can also control the devices (if your plugin has this functionality) with python-scripts, which you can write and run at runtime! This makes it also possible to plot everything else.
        There are some example-plugins and example-scripts included.
        It also offers an extended plotting-GUI with multiple plots, measure-tools, style-adjustments.
